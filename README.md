# Citi Bike Analysis

In this project, I analyzed data from CitiBike data from October 1st, 2019 to October 31st, 2019 (2,092,086 trips) to determine if CitiBike was an affordable system or if it was a luxury service. I found data to support the two opposing views. 

To see the analysis, clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/miscalculation/Citi-Bike.git```
    
You will need Python's Jupyter Notebook, which can be installed:
```brew install python3```
```pip3 install notebook```

To start the jupyter notebook, route to the local file in the terminal:
```jupyter notebook```
